#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I had a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I had also to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I had been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't worked offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What did I do from here?

1. In this folder, I start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on my local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

2. With my server running, I had visited the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. I had Explored the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. I had written code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, I tried to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript I wrote.
